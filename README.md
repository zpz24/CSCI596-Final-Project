# CSCI596-Final-Project
This is a proposal about the GPU-based parallel optimization technology. Aiming at the problem that standard parallel algorithms are difficult to run efficiently on the graphics processing unit (GPU). We will dive into the current stage of GPU-based Parallel Optimization Technology and possible ways to make it more efficient and also the expected results.
