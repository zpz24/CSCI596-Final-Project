# CSCI596-Final-Project: GPU-based Parallel Optimization
This is a proposal about the GPU-based parallel optimization. Aiming at the problem that standard parallel algorithms are difficult to run efficiently on the graphics processing unit (GPU). 

To solve it, we firstly dive into the current stage of GPU-based Parallel Optimization Technology. 

Then we collect the experimental content and results of these technologies by reading related papers. 

Finally summarize different ideas of optimization strategies by analyzing the experimental results and gathering the critical points of GPU performance optimization. We also give our hypothesis of the results of these ideas and some prospects of them.
